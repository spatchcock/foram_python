      "Let's consider a thin volume of sediment at surface of the seabed. A basic axiom is that any foraminiferal tests produced within this small volume must either be *removed* from the volume (e.g taphonomic destruction) or *accumulate* within the volume. Let's assume that taphonomic processes are absent and therefore no tests are lost. We'll also ignore bioturbation which may either remove tests from or add tests to a given volume of sediment. Finally, for simplicity, we'll assume that the rate of test production doesn't vary through time and is therefore a simple constant ($P$). \n",

      "where $C_0$ is the concentration of dead tests at the start (i.e. $t = 0$). It might be obvious that this model is a simple straight line with y-intercept $C_0$ and gradient $P$. So, depending on what the starting concentration ($C_0$) is in the volume we're considering (possibly zero), we can calculate the concentration at any later time, $t$. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of obvious drawbacks to this model. For example, the concentration of tests can become implausibly large with enough time, with nothing to check it. In reality, taphonomic processes may contribute to limiting test concentrations in many cases. But even without taphonomic processes, it is obvious that sediments do not continue to accumulate tests forever because they get buried away from the upper sedimentary zone of test production. So, perhaps the simple model described above would be a reasonable(-ish) model for short timescales where burial can be ignored. But it is not likely to be appropriate for any situation involving the timescales over which burial takes.\n"

From the perspective of our sedimentary volume, this looks like a *downward* movement relative to the sediment-water interface, *through* the zone of test production and beyond.

We'll label this rate $P_0$ to differentiate it from what is now the more generic *function* $P(t)$. When the layer is at a depth $x < X$, it receives tests at a rate $P_0$. When the layer is at a depth $x > X$, it receives no tests. If the rate of sedimentation is $w$, then we can say that the time it takes for the volume to pass through the depth $X$ is $\\frac {X}{w}$.
